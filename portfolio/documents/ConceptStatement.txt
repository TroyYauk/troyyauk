WaterfrontExpress! is a golf cart-based service that carries people to destinations on the waterfront while providing them with more information about any additional attractions or events from the help of friendly and knowledgeable staff who specialize in customer service.

The free service is centred upon a central station we call Station One, where users of all ages and abilities can book a ride on one of the electric powered carts, take shelter, get advice, and browse merchandise year-round. This way all patrons feel comfortable entering and inquiring about questions or concerns that they may have.

This service caters to any patrons who either may be in a hurry and need a quick ride to their destination, or by any uninformed customers who may need a little help or direction getting to their final destination. It solves this by providing quick and easy transportation and customer service inquiries along the Toronto Waterfront.
