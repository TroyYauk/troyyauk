We have designed a golf cart service for expansive tourist spaces like the Toronto Waterfront. In order to create a more accessible and navigable place for everyone.

The problem which we observed is that spaces like the Toronto Waterfront are big and have different kinds of services such as restaurants, events spaces, and cultural activities. It is not easy to navigate for people who are walking, let along people with mobility issues. There are no clear accessibility supports in the space. Additionally, patrons who are from out of town may not be as knowledgeable or have a keen sense of direction.

Our golf cart service has one main station near Ontario Square and Harbourfront Centre. Each cart is able to carry four people. Our carts are electric and will be stationed next to the station. People can get help in the station for more information and recommendations about the area, and once they decide where to go, they have the choice to book a free cart to get to their destination. 
		
Once the customer gets off, the cart can pick up anyone who needs a ride on the road. The stations will also be used to sell merchandise and provide shelter.

The carts will be driven by staff who specialize in customer service. This will provide the best opportunity to make all patrons feel more comfortable and at ease. While staff are driving without a customer, they may make stops to help any patrons along the way who may need additional assistance.
